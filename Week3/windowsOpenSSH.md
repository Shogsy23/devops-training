# This guide will help you setup and create your OpenSSH in Windows.

## Using Windows Command Line (CMD) 

1. **Check for the availability of OpenSSH using**
```
where ssh 
```

2. **Install OpenSSH (if not already installed)**
```
Windows 10 and later versions come with OpenSSH pre-installed. If you're using an older version, you might need to enable it manually.

Go to Settings > Apps > Optional Features.
Click Add a feature and select OpenSSH Client and OpenSSH Server. Install both.
```

3. **Create SSH Keys**
```
ssh-keygen
```

4. **Specify the path**
When prompted, specify the location for saving the keys (press Enter to save in the default location, usually your user directory). You can also set a passphrase for additional security

5. **Copy the Public Key**
```type C:\path\to\your\ssh\folder\id_rsa.pub
```
Replace C:\path\to\your\ssh\folder\id_rsa.pub with the actual path to your public key file. Copy the entire key starting with ssh-rsa.
