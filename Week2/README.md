## Week 2 Task

#### Task 1: Create a directory structure for a new website
- Create a new directory in your home directory called `www`
- Create a sub-directory called `www/html`
- Create 3 sub-directories called `www/html/img`, `www/html/css`, and `www/html/js`
- In each folder make a file with the names `testing.png` (`img` folder), `testing.css` (`css` folder), and `testing.js` (`js` folder)

### Guidelines:
1. This task is to be first done manually
2. Thereafter automated in a script file called `automate.sh`.
3. This script file will also be improved to allow the user to specify a name for the top level directory (instead of `www`).
4. The script should also check if the directory exists already and give the user a warning if it does.
